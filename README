*** Use with caution, as this overlay is under development. No gurantees are provided, but there are a few safe packages (only for amd64) that I have listed below ***

# Thamognya Overlay

This is my overlay with packages I write and test before making a pr to gentoo/gentoo or bugs.gentoo.org . This may or may not contain packages in the main repo, but they will usually be a version bump, eapi bump, new package or etc.

## Installation of overlay 

### adding to layman

`layman -o https://git.thamognya.com/Thamognya/thamognya-overlay/raw/branch/master/repositories.xml -f -a thamognya-overlay`

This adds the repository.xml to layman.

## Safe packages

- `sys-apps/fastfetch`
- `net-p2p/qbittorrent`
- `x11-terms/cool-retro-term`
